  "summary": "Frontend adds an admin-session hook that calls `adminLogin(password)` and persists a returned token, plus attempts to validate an existing token via `validateAdminSession`. Backend changes shown set/admin-migrate the admin password to `jatinkrs01` and introduce a separate migration module, but do not show (in the provided diff summary) the required password value `JATINSHARMA2580` or clear evidence of the backend session-validation API/error messaging behavior.",

      "reason": "The diff explicitly sets the admin password to `jatinkrs01` (not `JATINSHARMA2580`). Also, the provided backend snippet does not show the login failure path/error message for incorrect passwords.",
