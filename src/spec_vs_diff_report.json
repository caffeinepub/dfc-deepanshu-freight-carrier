  "summary": "The diff adds VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY with the specified key and updates AdminTrackingPanel to dynamically load the Google Maps JS script using callback=initMap and to render shipment markers. However, the acceptance criterion about showing the existing English warning message when the API key is not set is not clearly evidenced in the provided (truncated) diff. The diff also introduces documentation/state text implying a non-goal REST + public/maps.js approach.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "If the API key is not set, the Live Tracking view shows the existing English warning message that the Google Maps API key is not configured (no blank/white map).",
      "reason": "In AdminTrackingPanel, when apiKey is missing it sets mapError to null and returns, but the truncated diff does not show any UI branch that displays the existing warning message in this case, so this acceptance criterion is not verifiable from the diff summary provided.",
